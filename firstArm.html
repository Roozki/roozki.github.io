        <p class="infoboxPARA"> I started this project in early 2018. This was my first robotics project and my first time using Arduino. I spent some time learning the basics of Arduino, then I decided to make a small, 3D-printed robotic arm. This project is just a few servos hot-glued to some PLA and didn't turn out so well as I had no idea what torque was and never made any calculations. I put it all together and hoped for the best. The arm was able to pick up very light objects and move them around slowly. Even though the arm would abrutly fall apart more often than it would actually pick something up, I still learned a lot about Arduino programming and electronics.</p>
